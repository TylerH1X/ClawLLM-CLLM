# CLAW LLM

CLAW LLM is a **Large Language Model system** designed for real software creation and analysis.

It treats a Large Language Model as a **system of intelligence**, not a chat interface.  
CLAW LLM builds code, scans technology, and reasons over structure using a unified execution layer powered by the **OpenClaw API**.

---

## What CLAW LLM Does

CLAW LLM is built to operate across the full lifecycle of software understanding:

- Generate production-ready code across multiple files
- Plan architectures from high-level intent
- Scan and analyze existing systems and source code
- Surface risks, structural issues, and improvement paths
- Power multiple developer tools through a single model core

Every output is structured, deterministic, and intended to be used directly.

## How It Works

CLAW LLM is not a single prompt or response loop.  
It is an orchestration pipeline.

### Key Concepts

**Model as a System**  
The Large Language Model is treated as an engine that plans, evaluates, and builds — not just replies.

**Structured Outputs**  
All responses are returned as structured data (plans, files, patches, findings), not free-form text.

**Tool-First Design**  
Each feature (builder, scanner, refactorer) is a tool backed by the same intelligence layer.

---

## Core Systems

### Code Builder

The Builder interprets intent and produces complete software outputs.

- Architectural planning
- File and folder structures
- Multi-file code generation
- Setup and next-step guidance
- Iterative regeneration

The Builder produces code meant to be compiled, deployed, and extended.

---

### Tech & Code Scanner

The Scanner evaluates systems rather than summarizing them.

- Structural analysis
- Security and performance review
- Risk scoring
- Refactor suggestions
- Optional patch generation

The Scanner is designed to reason over real-world code and configurations.

---

### Multi-Tool Intelligence

CLAW LLM powers multiple tools through the same intelligence core:

- Code generation
- Code explanation
- Refactoring
- Test generation
- README generation
- API specification drafting
- System analysis

Each tool is a different interface to the same model reasoning layer.

---

## OpenClaw API

CLAW LLM is fully powered by the **OpenClaw API**.

OpenClaw provides:
- Model orchestration
- Prompt structuring
- Output validation
- Multi-tool reasoning support

CLAW LLM builds on OpenClaw to provide developer-facing systems rather than raw model access.

All intelligence flows through OpenClaw.

---

## Platform Design

### Security
- No client-side model execution
- No exposed API keys
- All intelligence handled server-side

### Reliability
- Deterministic structured responses
- Input validation and execution guards
- Tool-specific reasoning paths

### Performance
- Lightweight execution
- No unnecessary client compute
- Model calls optimized per tool

---

## Model Visualization

CLAW LLM includes a live 3D model rendered inside terminal-style containers.

The model represents the CLAW system itself:
- Controlled motion
- Performance-safe rendering
- User-controlled interaction
- Integrated directly into the interface

This visualization is symbolic, not decorative.

---

## Philosophy

A Large Language Model is not a chatbot.

It is:
- A planner
- A builder
- A scanner
- A reasoning engine

CLAW LLM is designed around this definition.

---

## Status

CLAW LLM is live and expanding.

Additional tools, deeper analysis layers, and extended system intelligence are actively in development.
